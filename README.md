Cervical cancer is the fourth leading cause of death in women globally with approximately 600,000 cases diagnosed each year. Approximately 50% of cases occur in women between the ages of 35 and 54 and HPV infection is associated with the majority of cervical cancer cases. In the U.S. cervical cancer mortality rates have been declining steadily since the development of early screening and detection with the Pap test. Several factors increase the risk of developing cervical cancer such as the age of the first sexual encounter, the number of partners you have had, smoking, HPV infection, prolonged use of oral contraception, etc. In adults, the biggest risk factor for HPV is sexual activity with an infected individual.
